dvdauthor for Debian
-------------------

  * In answer to the bug-report #225800, the upstream author ("Scott T. Smith"
  <scott@gelatinous.com> ) replied:

  I should just delete the script.  It used to create the directories; now
  dvdauthor creates them.  I only keep the script around because it can
  delete a previously authored disc.  Of course I know how to type 'rm -r
  -f'... it carries some historical significance -- you can create a conf
  file or set the WORKDIR environment variable so dvdauthor will always
  author the dvd in the same place -- useful if you have a separate HDD
  that you use for authoring.  In order to ease deleting from the remote
  directory I keep the script around

  * In order not to overwrite custom macros (AM_ICONV) aclocal should
  not be run unless the libraries are the 'latest' ones. for example,
  if you don't have iconv installed, then ./configure would detect that
  and be fine.  But if you run aclocal without gettext/iconv installed,
  then the macro for AM_ICONV will be overwriten, and the 'autoconf'
  program will fail, thus not allowing you to even run './configure'

  * Upstream added it's own man pages in SGML. For the time being,
  I keep the Debian versions included to allow merging of the information.
