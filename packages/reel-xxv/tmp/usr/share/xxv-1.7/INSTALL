After download xxv package, it's must unpacked. Please replace {VERSION} with 
your active release number and $SOURCEDIR with your prefered directory used by 
unpacking.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR
#> tar xvzf xxv-{VERSION}.tgz
#> cd xxv-{VERSION}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install mysql ------------------------------------------------------------------

If MySQL is not yet installed, install it from prebuilded packages or build 
it from source.

http://www.mysql.com/
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/installing-source.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets install.sh do the work ----------------------------------------------------

If you don't have prebuilded perl package for your system.  XXV help with a 
installation script $SOURCEDIR/install.sh. ( On Debian use ./install-debian.sh )

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/
#> ./install.sh

It's will be install xxv and depends perl modules inside /usr/local/... and 
create configuration, database and runlevel scripts. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual build and install depends perl modules ----------------------------------

For alternative way is installation with a little helper "Bundle::Xxv". 
It's enable the build of depends perl modules with online installation via cpan.
http://www.cpan.org/

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/lib
#> mkdir -p ~/.cpan/Bundle
#> cp Bundle/Xxv.pm ~/.cpan/Bundle
#> perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Xxv'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy some files ----------------------------------------------------------------

Install the man-page, which can be viewed later with man xxvd.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/
#> cp doc/xxvd.1 /usr/share/man/man1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enable rotation of logging files -----------------------------------------------

And don't forgot to activate the rotate of the log files.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/
#> cp etc/logrotate.d/xxvd /etc/logrotate.d/xxvd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjust and install configuration file ------------------------------------------

There is a example of configuration file, used by xxvd. Adjust now database 
connection and the mysql account, see below at database creation for details.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/
#> nano etc/xxvd.cfg.example
#> cp etc/xxvd.cfg.example /etc/xxvd.cfg

And as last step adjust your settings, like installation folder, location of 
configuration file and copy this runlevel script.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/
#> nano etc/xxvd
#> cp etc/xxvd /etc/init.d/xxvd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create initial database by prepared sql-script ---------------------------------

Use the provided script, to create the xxv database. But adapt before username 
and its password on 'contrib/create-database.sql', for a xxv used mysql account, 
with your personal preferences. If utf-8 encoding should used, your must 
edit 'contrib/create-database.sql'.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/xxv-{VERSION}/
#> cat contrib/create-database.sql | mysql -u root


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create initial database by hand ------------------------------------------------

Same can do alternatively in follow individually steps:

#> mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS xxv \
 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_general_ci;"

or if utf-8 encoding should used

#> mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS xxv \
 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;"


and grant access for your own mysql account (adjust username/password) 

#> mysql -u root -e "grant all privileges on xxv.* to \
  username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';"

#> mysql -u root -e "flush privileges;"


Now register the database connection and the mysql account in /etc/xxvd.cfg:

[General]
DSN=DBI:mysql:database=xxv;host=localhost;port=3306
PWD=password
USR=username


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade from older installations -----------------------------------------------

New or extended xxv-functions involve often also a change of the database 
structure. After the installation of an update, you should therefore call first 
always the script contrib/update-xxv. XXV should not be started at this time.

In the simplest case must transfer no parameters to her to the script. 
This presupposes however that MySQL on the local computer is installed that the 
database is called 'xxv' and the database administrator 'root' does not possess
a password.

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/contrib
#> ./update-xxv

Beyond that can to the script a set of parameters hand over, which also control
a few extended functions apart from the access to the database you.
An overview of all parameters receive you with:

#> cd $SOURCEDIR/contrib
#> ./update-xxv -h
  
  update-xxv
  ----------
  
  Usage: update-xxv [-b] [-h hostname] [-P port] [-d database]
                    [-u user] [-p password]
  
  -b {target}    : Make a backup first to {target}.gz
  -H {hostname}  : Host name of the MySQL server (default: localhost)
  -P {port}      : Port number of MySQL server
  -d {database}  : XXV database name (default: xxv)
  -u {user}      : Username (default: root)
  -p {password}  : Password (default: no password)
  -a             : Ask for password (once every run of mysql)
  -A             : Ask for password (just once)
  -f             : Force upgrade, do not check version
  -h             : Help

With the parameter -b is accomplished before the update a backup of the database. 
In addition the name of the backupfile (without the ending gz) must be indicated. 
The parameters -H (hostname) and -P (port) control the access to the MySQL server. 
This localhost and haven are according to standard 3306. 
If the database should not be called 'xxv', then can you with -D another name select.

The database user can specify you with -u and its password with -p. 
In order to be able to accomplish the update, the database user needs this 
access rights. Maybe usually only the administrator 'root' has this rights.

Safety reference:
With the delivery of the password in the command line parameters the password 
becomes visible for one moment for all other user of the local system
('ps -fA' indicates all processes with their parameters!). 
Alternatively have you therefore the possibility, by means of -a the update 
script for the password ask of letting. However the password is several 
times queried, since different database operations are necessary.


Database updates are accomplished by update xxv only if you are really necessary. 
Should times somewhat inclined run or if you would like on an old database 
structure 'downgrade', then can you the update with -f force.

With a successful database update a list of the accomplished actions spends update xxv:

  update-xxv
  ----------
  
  Info: Checking Server
  Info: Checking Database
  Info: Retrieving current version
  Info: current database version: 23
  Info: new database version: 26
  Info: Starting update...
  Info: Saving Data
  Info: Updating Database
  Info: Restoring Data
  Info: Updateing Version
  Info: Update successful

In the event of an error "error:..." messages spent. 
The most probable cause for an error is the database access. 
You should examine first thus username, password, database name and host.

After the update can you XXV again start:

#> /etc/init.d/xxvd start

Subsequently, control the log file:

#> tail -f /var/log/xxvd.log

If any error messages should emerge because of missing Perl modules in the log 
file, then should install these for her.
